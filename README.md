# Stock-Price-Prediction


## Project Overview
this project we will predict the price of the S&P500 stock market index using machine learning

## project status:

The base model has been build with a unimpressive accurancy of ~56% only slightly above the usual market flucation leaving lots of room for improvement

## future goals
currently the there is a lot of improvements that can be made to just the model alone but in the future the model can be greatly improved by accounting for more external data such as considering the international market or possibly gaining data from social media and news media outlets
